There have been no updates and commits for vulnman for some time now.

The reason is that the focus was moved to rebuild everything from scratch and follow the hype of modern frontend frameworks like VueJs.
During last month, I completly rewritten the backend part into a REST-API, learning VueJs and build a - hopefully not so ugly - new frontend.

vulnman will be deprecated once the new tool will be available.
The new version will have more advantages and can be easily integrated into other tools using its REST-API.
The database schema is a bit more flexible, more code reuse and other improvements in maintance.
There will be filters, searches and ways to order findings, projects and more, which was not done in original vulnman.

But be warned, I am not a developer and certainly not a frontend developer. ;)

The next version will be completly free and open source too.

If you have ideas for new features, improvements or want to contribute to the new tool before it is going public, feel free to reach out to `vulnman-project dot riseup dot net`.
