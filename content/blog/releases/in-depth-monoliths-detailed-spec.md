It's been a while since there have been any updates on vulnman.
Here is the first release candidate for v0.4.0.

There were many changes and the following list is just a small summary what is coming in the new release:

- Users can delete their accounts.
- many UI improvements (hopefully)
- rewritten handling of vulnerability scoring, which adds a new score for the `OWASP Risk Rating`.
- deleting and editing report versions
- Fix: 403 Forbidden when trying to create a new log entry in the BugHunting application.
- Rewritten report generator to be fully customizable with a bit of Python and web dev skills.
- Customers can be invited to vulnman and invited to projects.
- Users can reset their password
- Primary development migrated to Gitea. However, Github remains active for the time being.
- drop official docker support!
- ...


Happy testing!
