The Vulnman server relies on the existing vulnerability templates.

Since my current focus is on the core modules, the current templates are minimalistic and rather unsuitable for meaningful reports.

Feel free to contribute new vulnerability templates or improve existing ones.

Currently there is little to consider and the creation is very simple.


## Structure of Vulnerability Templates

First of all, the default *community vulnerability templates* repository is located [here](https://github.com/vulnman/community-vulnerability-templates).


There are 3 required files for a vulnerability template:
- **info.yaml**: Contains meta data information of the template
- **description_en.md**: A description of the vulnerability written in markdown syntax
- **resolution_en.md**: A recommendation of how the vulnerability can be fixed. Also supports markdown syntax.

### info.yaml template
```yaml
- id: cross-site-scripting
  name: Cross-Site Scripting
  severity: critical
  references:
    - "https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/"
  cwe:
    - CWE-79
  categories:
    - input-validation
```

Available categories can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/vulnman/community-vulnerability-templates/blob/main/templates/categories.yaml">categories.yaml</a> file
