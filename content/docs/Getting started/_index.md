After downloading and [install](/docs/Getting%20started/install-vulnman-server)
Vulnman, it's time to dive in and get to work!

## The Basics
Vulnman consists of 2 components, the vulnman-server and vulnman-scanner.
You can use the vulnman-server without the scanner component.

Further components and wordings are described in the [glossary](/docs/glossary/).
