  How to test upcoming releases
---

Testing new vulnman releases and updates is one of the most helpful ways in
which you can [contribute](/docs/contribution-guidelines/) to the vulnman project.

**Warning:** Software testing is intended for advanced users and developers.
You should only attempt to do this if you know what you're doing. Never rely on
code that is in testing for critical work!


## The Main Branch
The main branch is used for development purposes and should not be used for critical work.
If you want to test upcoming releases, download the code from the *main* branch.

If you are using docker, use the `main` tag, which is build on every commit in the main branch.



## Providing feedback

Since the whole point of testing software is to discover and fix bugs, [your
feedback](/docs/issue-tracking/#how-to-open-a-new-issue) is an essential part of this process.
